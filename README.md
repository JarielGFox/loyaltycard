# Loyalty Card - WORK IN PROGRESS
A loyalty card-like website that allows users to register and obtain one or more automatically generated loyalty cards. Users can access a catalog of prizes that can be claimed with points. There is an admin panel where cards can be managed, and points can be added or removed. This project has been developed using Bootstrap classes, the Laravel framework, and some sprinkles of Livewire. This small project enables you to:

- Create, edit, and delete new products in the catalog.
- Edit and update points of a loyalty card (with a dedicated admin panel).
- Manage users and assign them roles.
